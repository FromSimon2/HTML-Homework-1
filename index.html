    <summary>Where to start in the Soulsborne and Soulslike Game Genres</summary>
    <p>For newcomers, it is recommended to start with games in the Soulsborne genre. Dark Souls 1 is the the best starting point for those new to the genre. Conquering the game 
will provide a solid foundation for understanding the mechanics and themes of Soulsborne games, making it easier to transition to other titles in the genre and eventually explore 
Soulslike games. Then I would recommed Dark Souls 3 next, as it is the most accessible and has a lot of quality of life improvements compared to the previous games. After that, 
you can explore other titles in the Soulsborne like Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice and Elden Ring. If you have a Playstation, Bloodborne is a must-play. For those interested in Soulslike games. Hollow Knight is a great starting point
but if you are looking for gameplay similar to the Soulsborne genre, consider trying Black Myth: Wukong or Lies of P.</p>
